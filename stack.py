#for below time averages assume a linked list type structure 
#access: average: O(n), worst: O(n) for nonlist implementation, but here using list then its O(1) and O(1)

#search: average: O(n), worst: O(n)

#insert: average: O(1), worst: O(1)

#delete: same as above 

#QUEUE IS THE SAME AS STACK BUT FIRST IN FIRST OUT AND INSTEAD OF PUSH AND POP ITS QUEUE AND ENEQUEUE
